An e wS2 control chart is presented for monitoring the process variance by utilizing a repetitive sampling
scheme. The double control limits called inner and outer control limits are proposed, whose coefﬁcients
are determined by considering the average run length (ARL) and the average sample number when the
process is in control. The proposed control chart is compared with the existing Shewhart S2 control chart
in terms of the ARLs. The result shows that the proposed control chart is more efﬁcient than the existing
control chart in detecting the process shift.
Keywords: repetitive sampling; control chart; average run length; process shift
1. Introduction
The control charts are the statistical tools widely used in industries to monitor the manufacturing
process. Although the latest machinery is available to a manufacturer, there is a chance of varia-
tion in the process due to several factors. When the process is out of control, industrial engineers
are required to remove the cause of the variation in time. Therefore, researchers are trying to
explore new control charts so that the out-of-control signal can be given as soon as the process
is going out of control. Shewhart originally developed the control chart schemes to monitor the
process, but the Shewhart control charts are known to be useful to detect large shifts quickly.
Traditionally, the Shewhart-type control charts such asR, S and S
2 control charts are popularly
used for monitoring the process variance. Research on improving the performance of these con-
trol charts is still ongoing. Khoo [12] proposed an S
2 control chart based on the double sampling
approach. Zhang et al. [26] presented the statistical design of the S2 chart. Lee [15] designed the
adaptive R charts by considering the variable parameters of the chart. Lee et al. [16] presented
the designing method of S control charts by combining double sampling and variable sampling

interval (VSI) schemes. Guo and Wang [9] presented the designing of the S2 chart providing an
unbiased estimator of the average run length (ARL) when in-control variance is estimated.
Lots of other types of control charts for controlling the variability have been developed. Chen
[7] discussed the ARL distributions of different variability charts. David [ 8] discussed early
sample measures of variability. Khoo [11 ] proposed the modiﬁed S chart for process variance.
Huang and Chen [ 10] designed a synthetic control chart for monitoring the process standard
deviation. Riaz [20] proposed a dispersion control chart called ‘Q-chart’. Riaz and Saghir [ 21]
designed a mean-deviation-based control chart. Mahmoud et al. [17] discussed the estimation of
standard deviation in control chart applications. Rakitzis and Antzoulakos [ 19] worked on the
improvement of the one-sided S control chart. Schoonhoven et al. [22] designed a control chart
for a process standard deviation when the estimation of parameters is needed. Kuo and Lee [13]
developed the design of an adaptive standard deviation control chart. Zafar et al. [24] proposed
the progressive variance control chart for monitoring process dispersion. Zhang [25] designed the
improved R and S control chart for monitoring process variance. Ahmad et al. [1,2] developed
an efﬁcient median chart.
The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the repetitive sampling approach to developing a
new control chart. Repetitive sampling was originally proposed by Sherman [23] for developing
an attributes acceptance sampling plan. The operation of the repetitive sampling is similar to the
sequential sampling scheme. Later on, according to Balamurali and Jun [ 6], repetitive sampling
is applied to develop more efﬁcient variables acceptance sampling plans. The idea of repetitive
sampling is different from the double sampling approach or the VSI approach. In a double sam-
pling or a repetitive sampling scheme, a second sample is taken if the decision cannot be made
on the ﬁrst sample. Usually, the double sampling scheme is based on four parameters and so it is
difﬁcult to apply from an administrative point of view. On the other hand, the repetitive sampling
scheme is simpler to apply because it is based on two parameters. The repetitive sampling scheme
is also different from the VSI scheme in that the latter adjusts the sampling interval instead of
the control limits. Therefore, the control charts based on the repetitive sampling scheme will be
different from the existing control charts in the literature. Recently, Aslamet al. [3,4] proposed a
t-control chart using repetitive sampling and Ahmad et al. [1,2] designed the X -bar control chart
based on the process capability index using repetitive sampling and proved its efﬁciency. Azam
et al. [5] designed a hybrid EWMA chart using repetitive sampling for normal distribution. Lee
et al. [14] proposed a control chart using an auxiliary variable and repetitive sampling to detect
the process mean. Aslam et al. [3,4]
designed some attribute and variable control charts using
repetitive sampling for monitoring the process mean.
By exploring the literature, we note thatS or S2 control charts are available based on the single
and double sampling approaches. No attempt has been made to propose S or S2 control charts
using the repetitive sampling scheme. In this paper, we expect that the S2 control chart using
repetitive sampling will be more efﬁcient than the S2 control chart based on the single sampling
scheme. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the designing of the proposed control
chart is given in Section 2. The performance comparison with the Shewhart S
2 chart is given in
Section 3 and a simulation study using synthetic data is given in Section 4. Some concluding
remarks are given in the last section.
2. Designing of new S2 control chart
We proposed the following S2 control chart using repetitive sampling.
Step 1 Take a sample of size n. Calculate S2 from the sample data.
Step 2 Declare the process as out-of-control if S2 ≥ UCL1 or S2 ≤ LCL1 (UCL1 and LCL1
are called the outer control limits). Declare the process as in-control if LCL 2 ≤ S2 ≤ UCL2

(UCL2 and LCL2 are called the inner control limits). Otherwise, go to Step 1 and repeat the
process.
The rationale of the proposed control chart is that the decision can be made from the ﬁrst
sample when the evidence is sufﬁcient but it may be better to postpone when the evidence is not
enough.
These four control charts’ limits for the proposed control chart are given as follows when σ2
is known. The outer control limits are given by
UCL1 = σ2 + k1
√
2(σ2)2
(n − 1),L C L 1 = σ2 − k1
√
2(σ2)2
(n − 1),
where k1 is a constant to be determined. The inner control limits are
UCL2 = σ2 + k2
√
2(σ2)2
(n − 1),L C L 2 = σ2 − k2
√
2(σ2)2
(n − 1),
where k2 is a constant to be determined.
The probability that the process is declared to be out of control based on a single sample is
P(1)
out = P(S2 ≥ UCL1) + P(S2 ≤ LCL1).( 1)
Note that (n − 1)S2/σ2 follows the chi-square distribution with degree of freedomn − 1i ft h e
process is in control. Let G be the distribution function (df) of such a distribution. Then, when
the process is in control,
P(S2 ≥ UCL1) = 1 − G
((n − 1)UCL1
σ2
)
= 1 − G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 + k1
√
2
n − 1
))
.
Similarly,
P(S2 ≤ LCL1) = G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 − k1
√
2
n − 1
))
.
So, ﬁnally Equation (1) can be rewritten as follows when the process is in control,
P(1)
out = 1 + G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 − k1
√
2
n − 1
))
− G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 + k1
√
2
n − 1
))
.( 2 )
The probability that the process is declared to be in-control based on a single sample can be
calculated as follows:
P(1)
in = P(LCL2 ≤ S2 ≤ UCL2) = P(S2 ≤ UCL2) − P(S2 ≤ LCL2),
and when the process is in control
P(1)
in = G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 − k2
√
2
n − 1
))
− G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 + k2
√
2
n − 1
))
.( 3 )
The probability of repetition can be calculated as follows:
Prep = P{LCL1 ≤ S2 < LCL2}+ P{UCL2 < S2 ≤ UCL1}.

So, when the process is in control
Prep =
{
G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 − k1
√
2
n − 1
))
− G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 − k2
√
2
n − 1
))}
+
{
G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 + k2
√
2
n − 1
))
− G
(
(n − 1)
(
1 + k1
√
2
n − 1
))}
.
(4)
Therefore, the probability the process is declared to be out of control for the proposed plan when
the process is actually in control is given as follows:
Pout = 1 + G((n − 1)( 1 − k1
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1)(1 + k1
√ 2/n − 1))
1 − [{G((n − 1)(1 − k1
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1)(1 − k2
√ 2/n − 1))}
+{G((n − 1)(1 + k2
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1)(1 + k1
√ 2/n − 1))}].
(5)
The average sample number (ASN) for the proposed control chart when the process is in
control is given by
ASN0 = n
1 − [{G((n − 1)(1 − k1
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1)(1 − k2
√ 2/n − 1))}
+{G((n − 1)(1 + k2
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1)(1 + k1
√ 2/n − 1))}]
.( 6 )
Now we derive the equations when the process is shifted. Suppose that the process variance
has been shifted from σ2 to σ2
1 = cσ2 for a constant c while the mean remains the same. Now,
(n − 1)S2/(cσ2) follows the chi-square distribution with degree of freedom n − 1.
The probability that the process is declared to be out of control under variance shift is derived
as follows.
P(1)
out,shift = P(S2 ≥ UCL1|σ2
1 ) + P(S2 ≤ LCL1|σ2
1 ),
= 1 + G
(
n − 1
c
(
1 − k1
√
2
n − 1
))
− G
(
n − 1
c
(
1 + k1
√
2
n − 1
))
.
(7)
Hence, the probability that the process is declared as out-of-control when the process is shifted
can be obtained as follows:
Pout,shift = 1 + G((n − 1/c)(1 − k1
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1/c)(1 + k1
√ 2/n − 1))
1 − [{G((n − 1/c)(1 − k1
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1/c)(1 − k2
√ 2/n − 1))}
+{G((n − 1/c)(1 + k2
√ 2/n − 1)) − G((n − 1/c)(1 + k1
√ 2/n − 1))}]

The ARL when the process is under control is given as
ARL0 = 1

The ARL when the process is out of control is given as
ARL1 = 1

The coefﬁcients k1 and k2 for the proposed control chart can be determined by considering the
target ARL0, when the process is in control while keeping the ASN0 in Equation (6) as minimal
as possible.
We presented the control coefﬁcients in Table 1 for various sample sizes (n ) when ARL 0 =
200, where the ARLs as well as ASNs are reported according to various shift constants (c’s). We
used n = 4, 5, 6, 7 and c from 1.0 to 2.0 with the increment of 0.1. Table 2 is the case when
ARL0 = 300 and Table 3 is the case when ARL0 = 375.
From Tables 1–3, we note the following trends in the proposed control charts:
(1) When c increases from 1.1 to 2.0, we note the decreasing trend in ARL1 in Tables 1–3.
(2) As n changes from 4 to 7 while other values remain unchanged, we note the decreasing trend
in ARL1.

Example. Let us consider an example for automobile engine piston rings taken from Mont-
gomery [18 ]. Each subgroup consists of ﬁve piston rings. Suppose that the proposed control
chart is used by specifying ARL 0 = 370. Then, from Table 3 we determined the control chart
coefﬁcients as k1 = 4.37021 and k2 = 1.92006. The value of S2 is 0.000100627. The four con-
trol limits using sample estimates of the proposed chart for automobile engine piston rings data
are computed as follows. First, the outer control limits are given by
UCL1 = S2 + k1
√
2(S2)2/(n − 1)
= 0.000100627 + 4.37021
√
2(0.000100627)2/4 = 0.000411584,
LCL1 = S2 − k1
√
2(S2)2/(n − 1)
= 0.000100627 − 4.37021
√
2(0.000100627)2/4 =− 0.000210331,
UCL2 = S2 + k2
√
2(S2)2/(n − 1)
= 0.000100627 + 1.92006
√
2(0.000100627)2/4 = 0.000237247,
LCL2 = S2 − k2
√
2(S2)2/(n − 1)
= 0.000100627 − 1.92006
√
2(0.000100627)2/4 =− 0.00035992.
The proposed control for this data is shown in Figure 1.
The values of S2 are plotted along with four control limits in Figure 1. From Figure 1,w es e e
that there have been several cases requiring repetitive sampling such as the subgroups 3 and 6.
But it turns out that the process is in control.

3. Comparative study
In this section, we will compare the efﬁciency of the proposed control chart with the existing
S2 control charts. The control chart with smaller values of ARLs is said to be more efﬁcient. So,
the efﬁciency of charts will be discussed in terms of ARLs.
3.1 Proposed S2 control chart versus Shewhart S 2 chart
The traditional Shewhart S2 control chart is based on single sampling and has two control limits.
The proposed S2 control chart is the extension of the Shewhart S2 control chart because the
proposed chart becomes the Shewhart S2 control chart when k1 = k2. We presented two tables
for the comparison purpose. Table 4 is given when ARL 0 = 300 and Table 5 is given when
ARL0 = 375. We selected these values of ARL0 as commonly used in the area of quality control.
From Tables 4 and 5, we note that the values of ARL 1 are smaller in the proposed control
charts as compared to the ShewhartS2 control chart. For example, when ARL0 = 370, n = 5 and
c = 1.5 from Table5, we note ARL1 = 30.7 from the proposed control chart while ARL1 = 35.1
from the existing Shewhart control chart. It is noted that the difference between the proposed
chart and the Shewhart S2 control chart is increased as n is increased. The difference of the
ARL1 values between two control charts increases when the process shifts increase.
3.2 Proposed chart versus chart by Zhang et al. [26]
Now, the ARL comparison of the proposed chart and the chart by Zhang et al. [26] is presented.
Again, the same speciﬁed parametric values are taken for the comparison purpose. It can be

seen that the proposed control chart provides a smaller value of ARLs as compared to the chart
by Zhang et al. [26]. For example, when c = 1.5, r0 = 370 and n = 5, from Table 3, we note
ARL1 = 30.70 from the proposed control chart while ARL 1 = 70 from Zhang et al. [26]. Sim-
ilarly, when c = 2, r0 = 370 and n = 5, from Table 3, we note ARL 1 = 9 from the proposed
control chart while ARL1 = 13 from the Zhang et al. [26] chart. So, the proposed chart is more
efﬁcient than the Zhang et al. [26] chart in detecting the shift in the process.
4. Simulation study
In this section, the performance of the proposed control chart is demonstrated with the help of

and σ2 = 4. The ﬁrst 10 observations are generated from the in-control process and the next 30
observations are generated with the shifted process, which follows a normal distribution with
μ = 0 and variance of 1.5 σ2 = 6. The data are reported in Table 6.
For this simulation study, let ARL0 = 370 and n = 5. The four control limits for the simulated
data are as follows:
UCL1 = 16.36, LCL 1 =− 8.36, UCL 2 = 9.43 and LCL 2 =− 1.43.
The values of S2 are also reported in Table 6. The values of S2 are plotted on the control chart
in Figure 3. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the proposed chart detects the shift at the 39th
value. The values of S2 are also plotted on the traditional Shewhart S2 control chart in Figure 3,
which could not detect the shift in the process. So, the proposed control chart has the ability to
detect shift quickly as compared to the existing control chart.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, a new S2 control chart under the repetitive sampling scheme is presented for mon-
itoring the process variance. The tables are given for the practical application of the proposed
control chart in the industries. The proposed control chart is more efﬁcient than the Shewhart
S2 control chart in terms of the ARL as the former declares out-of-control more quickly. It is
strongly suggested to use the proposed control chart in the industry to monitor the process vari-
ability instead of the existing control charts because it is more efﬁcient and easier to apply. The
proposed repetitive sampling scheme can be applied to other types of control charts to improve
the performance of early detection of the process shift. Still, there may a room to improve the
proposed control chart by incorporating the exponentially weighted moving average or the cumu-
lative sum. Furthermore, an extensive study of comparing the performance of the existing control
charts in a fair ground is necessary.
